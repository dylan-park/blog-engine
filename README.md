# blog-engine

A lightweight  backend blog engine for my personal website that automatically converts Markdown files into blog posts. The engine dynamically generates Markdown -> HTML conversions and pagination on page load.

## Features

- **100% Rust** - Built entirely in Rust for performance and reliability
- **Markdown-based** - Write posts in Markdown with support for basic styling
- **Minimal static HTML** - Most content is dynamically generated, and applied to basic HTML templates
- **Hot-reload content** - New posts appear instantly without server restarts
